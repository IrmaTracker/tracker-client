Backend:
- Django

## Making a Pull Request
When you make a pull request, there will be instructions on how you should format your pull request.

The TL;DR of it is name your branch with the type and main change (i.e. `evol/help-page`) and add a description with the changes in a list format.

You need to have one accepted review before merging, but you should be able to bypass that due to the nature of this project.

## TypeScript?
Message @sirmerr if you don't have experience in TypeScript. It's pretty straightforward and we're not doing anything too fancy for this. The main point is to be fast, but scalable, which is why we're using it. It's also extremely helpful with us using frameworks that have typed definitions :). It basically auto-completes and auto-corrects us automatically (auto x3). Hurray :clap: !

## Thank You!
Thank you everyone that has helped contribute and support this. It is likely that this will get sidelined by Facebook's own integration of a people tracker, but since this is a current need, thank you to all the people whom have given up some of their time to help people find their loved one.

_also the icon at the top is a tornado but that's ok_
